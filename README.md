# Goldberg Drywall Application

## Description:

The Goldberg Drywall application was designed and implemented for use by a small business contractor. Most private business owners on this scale cannot afford, would not even come close to using all the tools, or even want to take the time to learn large scale commercial products. This app allows for the regular Joe/Jill, to keep track of basic Customer information and the current list of Jobs they have going at the time. The user can **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, or even **Delete** the data as they see fit without having to train on how to do so.
